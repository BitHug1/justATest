      <h2>The Updated American Silhouette</h2>

      <p class='quote'>The updated American silhouette is a combination of
      the best elements of the sack and the European-cut
      suit. The jacket has some of the same softness and
      fullness through the chest and shoulder areas of the
      sack, to which it adds some of the European notion of
      shape.</p>
      <p>Long the staple of fine dressers, from Clark Gable to
      Fred Astaire to Cary Grant, this soft, shaped suit was
      essentially a spin-off from the sack. The three-button
      sack coat was modified to a two-button version with
      some suppression at the waist by Paul Stuart. As
      mentioned earlier, this style was then modified further
      by Ralph Lauren, beginning in the mid-1960s. Both his
      espousal of it and the subsequent support of a score of
      young American designers gained, for this updated
      American style, the national recognition and the
      widespread acceptance it has today.</p>

      <h2>The European Silhouette</h2>

      <p class='quote'>Only since the late 1960s has the European-cut silhouette
      been a major factor on the American scene. This shape
      relies upon severity of line to project its style. The
      dominant shape and style in France and Italy for the past
      thirty years, it has been maintained in a jacket with
      squarish shoulders, high armholes, and a tight fit through
      the chest and hips. It is two- buttoned, its back is usually
      non-vented, and it has a much more structured feel to it
      than the sack suit. The trousers tend to have a lower rise
      and fit more snugly through the buttocks and thigh,
      sitting just under the waist so that one feels them fitting
      through the hips and thigh, hugging the line of the leg.</p>
      <p>As Stephen Birmingham pointed out in Vogue, European
      men liked to “ ‘feel’ the clothes they wore...a man in a European-cut suit was very
      much aware that he was inside something. Sitting down was a delicate operation, and
      crossing the legs was not to be undertaken lightly....”
      In the 1960s and ‘70s, the European fit gained much popularity in this country, in part
      because of the mass acceptance of jeans and the notion that clothes ought to express a
      man’s physicality. This silhouette offered a radical alternative to the sack suit and
      appealed particularly to women, who perhaps unintentionally promoted this
      exaggerated style, which emphasizes a man’s sexuality at the cost of subtlety and
      comfort. While it is true that a man wearing this silhouette did look thinner, it is also
      clear that he was compromising taste and style in order to feel thin.</p>
